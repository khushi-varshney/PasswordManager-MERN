<p>Happy to showcase my another recent project, A Password Manager Application which is not only secure but optimized as well. This project is built using React JS, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, Express and MongoDB. This particular project is a perfect representation of my expertise in Full-Stack Development, User Experience and Data Security. </p>
