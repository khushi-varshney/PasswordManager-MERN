<p>Happy to showcase my another recent project, A Password Manager Application which is not only secure but optimized as well. This project is built using React JS, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, Express and MongoDB. This particular project is a perfect representation of my expertise in Full-Stack Development, User Experience and Data Security. </p>
<h3>Key Features : </h3>
<ul>
   <li>Secure password storage and retrieval.</p>
   <li>A Contact form is provided in case if user have any query. Firebase Authentication is used to deal with the user queries and problems.,li>
   <li>Responsive Design for mobile and desktop devices</li>
